# Julie Hudson Capstone Project

## Definition of your audience:
Savvy instructors and cohorts

Hiring managers 

Consumers of product: people who are experiencing symptoms of COVID and other illnesses, and by extension, their medical providers



## Definition statement:
I want to create a web application that allows people with COVID and other illnesses to 
track their symptoms, 
share them with their medical team, and 
communicate with other people who are going through the same medical issues.



## High level story (elevator pitch):
COVID is one of the biggest issues facing businesses and individuals today. One of the issues that COVID patients face is brain fog, which makes it challenging for them to communicate with their doctors. If they can‚Äôt remember all the issues they are facing, they aren‚Äôt able to get the care they need. This application (tentatively called reMission Control) is a tool for them to communicate effectively with their doctors so they can get the best treatment possible, so they can get back to normal life and back to work. It also enables them to communicate with other people facing the same issue.

This can additionally be customized for people managing other medical issues.



## Define what my app offers that others do not:
My app is easy to use, with features found in multiple other apps all in one place. My app allows for customizable symptoms. The pain scale used is the new, objective pain scale developed by the Department of Defense in 2019 that helps the medical provider understand in an objective way the extent to which the patient is impacted by their issue. Instead of ‚Äúhurts a little‚Äù or ‚Äúhurts a lot,‚Äù which are subjective, patients can communicate clearly about concrete concerns like whether the issue they face is distracting to them, they have to avoid activities because of it, or they can‚Äôt focus on anything else.

This application will serve the needs of both the patient and the provider in a way that nothing else on the market today does.

# Savvy Coders Project Boilerplate Starter Kit

## Overview

This template repository contains several opinionated, 'starter' files and settings to help Savvy Coder students focus more time and energy on learning how to code and/or craft 'business logic' for projects and less time on configurations.

In addition to a '.gitignore' and some VS Code specific extensions and settings, it includes the 'recommended' settings for:

1. [ESLint](eslint.org)
2. [Stylelint](stylelint.io)
3. [Prettier](prettier.io)

## Get Started

**First and foremost,** make sure that your local machine is set up with all of the 'dev environment tooling' as per [this guide...](https://www.notion.so/codefinity/Setting-up-a-Local-Dev-Environment-97de62a546f943fbbc7a246b4785a343)

Well, after establishing your directory structure on your local machine, (e.g. '~/Code/SavvyCoders'), kindly [follow these girections](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) - essentially, there should be a button üëÜüèæthat says **Use this template.**

Once this repo has been created on your GitHub, you can click on the button to 'clone' it as usual. Once it's `clone`d to your local machine, kindly `cd` into the directory and **be sure to do:** `npm i` to get all of the goodies. If you see any _errors_ (warnings are üôÜüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) on Windows, you may have to do `npm install`.

Now, enter `code .` to open this project in VS Code, and look for a prompt to 'install some extensions' once inside VS Code (in the bottom right of your screen). You should install these. üëçüèæ

Update this README and make any other initial changes or üå± files, etc. Go ahead and do your usual `git` steps, etc. etc. etc.

**Note:** This is a template repository, no need to 'fork it.
